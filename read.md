Validation: Handles field-level validation based on the schema.
Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile screens using Tailwind CSS.
Error Handling: Shows errors for invalid JSON in the editor and form validation issues.
Submission: Logs submitted data to the console and displays a success message.
Tech Stack
React: Frontend framework.
TypeScript: For type safety and improved code quality.
React Hook Form: For form handling and validation.
Tailwind CSS: For modern and responsive styling.
